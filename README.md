# Image-Captioning
Training a CNN-RNN model to predict captions for a given image
# Project Overview: Building a CNN-RNN Network for Image Captioning
In this project, I implemented an encoder-decoder architecture using Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network for automatically generate captions from images. The training data is [COCO dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/coco).
